# aurora hackboard üçì
a custom mechanical pastel themed keyboard designed and coded from scratch (successor to hackpad v2) :3

## schematic 
i made and scrapped and remade this like 20 times because there was so so much variety to choose from. i didn't know if i wanted my keyboard to have a screen, a usb hub, be a split keyboard or have some other unique features but settled on having a gamer-style keyboard with a small screen, backlights for each key and a usb c port.
